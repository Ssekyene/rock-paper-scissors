    <P>Open the console (in the developers tools) eg (CTRL + SHIFT + J) for chrome browser and then click on the button below to play!</P>
    <p>Each turn of play has a maximum of 5 rounds.</p>
    <p>The game will end before finishing all rounds when one of the players is left with few rounds to make them either a win or a draw. eg When one hits 3 wins in 3 rounds, the other is left with 2 rounds and therefore has no chance to make it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Win - 1 point</li>
        <li>Lose - no point</li>
        <li>Draw - no point for each</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> When you enter something wrong you replay the round!</p>
    <p>To play more rounds, click the reset button and then the play button.</p>
